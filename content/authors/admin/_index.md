Hello,
I am Physics graduate and an aspiring Astronomer and Astrophysicist.

I am currently working on the 'Bayesian Analysis of Detached Eclipsing Binaries (dEBs)' under the guidance of [Dr. Kyle Conroy](http://www.keconroy.com/) at Villanova University, US. Prior to this, I performed a detailed study in the Modelling and Analysis of Binary Stars as a Summer Intern at the [Indian Institue of Technology, Bombay (IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), India. Apart from this, I love to study Supernovae, Transients, Nebulae, and Nucleosynthesis.

I received my Bachelors of Science (B.Sc) degree in Physics from [Fergusson College (Autonomous)](http://www.fergusson.edu/), Pune. Through the college's [Astro Club](https://www.astroclubfc.com/), I have volunteered and outreached Astronomy and Astrophysics through various activities to college as well as school students. Talking about Astronomy and Scientific Thinking has always been my strength and never leaves a chance to encourage students to pursue what they like.

Along with Astronomy, I am an avid trekker and photographer, and loves to cook!
